## 💡 Recommendations

⚠️ **Coverage below threshold.** Consider adding tests for:
   - src/app_unified.py (36.2% coverage)
   - src/core/change_categorization.py (87.6% coverage)
   - src/core/unified_processor.py (87.7% coverage)
   - src/core/change_detector.py (89.8% coverage)

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Focus on critical modules** with coverage below 90%
2. **Add edge case tests** for complex logic
3. **Improve integration test coverage** for external service interactions
4. **Add performance regression tests** for critical paths
5. **Enhance security test coverage** for input validation
